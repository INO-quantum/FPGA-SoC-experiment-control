#give as r0:r1:r2:level. with relative ratios with respect to r0+r1+r2=1/bus output frequency.
#level = 1 or 2 = active high or toggle. 
#if level 1 then strobe is high from r0 to r1, if 2 then toggles state at r0.
#might be overwritten by software.

#optional number of CPUs must be 1=Cora-Z7-07S or 2=Cora-Z7-10. default = 2.

#optional waiting time before data is generated. primary=0, secondary=6 (typically). default = 0.
#might be overwritten by software.

#optional synchronization phase as hex number. primary=0, secondary=0x1c308c (typically). default = 0.
#consists of {phase_ext[11:0],phase_det[11:0]}
#each phase = 0..560 steps = 0..360 degree = 18ps/step (10ns/560)
#upper 12bits = external clock phase, use to fine-adjust synchronization time
#lower 12bits = detection phase, use to select low-jitter trigger window, does not affect synchronization. (typically 90 degree = 140 = 0x8c)
#phase=0
